## Improve the Faust Website

* Currently addressed by: Romain

There's lots of work to do here, in particular:

* Improve the doc (see [corresponding item](#rewrite-the-faust-documentation-in-markdown))
* Add tutorials structured in a clear way (not as news posts)
* Make things more obvious
* Improve the overall design/theme, the new Faust logo should be more visible
* Highlight the web editor: make it a central component of the website

## Implement Jonathan Abel's Modal Reverb

* Currently addressed by: Romain and Yann

This should be done as part of the Longyou grottoes project. The "final goal"
would be to create an interactive website where users can process the sound of
their microphone to apply the acoustics of this ancient space. Modal reverb
would allow to interpolate between IRs and change some of the parameters of
the space in real-time. It'd be nice if this could be reproducible so we need
to think about a way to nicely generate these reverbs from an impulse response.
This tool could be similar to `mesh2faust` or could come as part of a toolkit
in matlab/octave/pyhton, etc.

## Improved UI Declarations

* Currently addressed by: Romain and Yann

Essentially allow for specific UI elements to have metadatas associated to them
outside of their declaration. As part of that, we want to implement a system
to further customize UI elements. 

### Potential Implementation

Several approaches are being considered to further customize UI elements. The 
first one would consist of being able to declare a "CSS" allowing for the use
of CSS code. Another approach (more generic and not limited to the web) would
allow for the declaration of UI-specific metadata inspired by CSS. 

```
declare UI "
  synth{
    background-color: blue;
  }
  synth/freq{
    tooltip: Frequency parameter of the synth;
    width: 70%;
  }
  synth/gain{
    style: knob;
    tooltip: Gain parameter of the synth;
    width: 70%;
  }
";

f = hslider("freq",400,50,1000,0.1);
g = hslider("gain",0.5,0,1,0.01);
process = hgroup("synth",os.sawtooth(f)*g);

```

Of course, it would still be possible to declare metadatas within the UI
declaration (this system would be fully backward compatible). Internally,
we'd have to parse the metadata and create a corpus of supported CSS metadatas
knowing that interfaces would be based on a specific kind of layout (e.g.,
grid layout). Once again, another option would be to allow to specify "pure
CSS" giving access to all the CSS features without having to do some 
reformatting.

## TensorFlow Support

* Currently addressed by: nil

Be able to generate TensorFlow code with Faust.

---

## Improved Linear Algebra Support

* Currently addressed by: nil

Linear algebra operations are currently poorly supported in Faust. Having a
way to conveniently express matrices would improvement. As part of that,
linear algebra/matrix operations (e.g., inversion, multiplication, determinant,
etc.) primitives could be added to the language.

### Potential Implementation

Matrices could be expressed using the Faust-multirate `vectorize` primitives
by creating vectors of vectors.

It would be interesting to try to implement matrix operations from scratch in 
Faust. Although it might be hard and not so optimized, thus a more pragmatic
solution would be to implement them as primitives. That would be a fair amount
of work as this would imply that the corresponding code for each language
supported by Faust would have to be supported.

## Finish the DX7 Implementation

Essentially, finish `dx7.lib`. It might be worth looking at these elements to
make this happen:

* <https://webaudiomodules.org/demos/wasm/dx7.html>
* <https://github.com/everythingwillbetakenaway/DX7-Supercollider>

## Trigonometric simplifications

* Currently addressed by: nil (suggested by [Pierre Leconte](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/issues/59))

For some applications, trigonometric functions (spherical harmonics) are used, and depending on the algorithm, the output formula could be very complicated. However, in a lot of cases, trigonometric identities could help to simplify drastically the expressions.

---

## WebAssembly specific optimisations

* Currently addressed by: St√©phane and Yann

To run as fast as possible and approch native code performances as much as possible, WebAssembly code requires some specific optimisations, like: memory access (index precomputation as much as possible...), delay lines handling, struct/stack variables access...etc. We have started an informal collaboration with Mozilla engineers (Benjamin Bouvier) to work on this subject.

---

## Testing tools on the Web

* Currently addressed by: nil

Faust distribution already contains some testing tools, like `faust2plot` or `faust2octave`.etc. It would be great to have them running in a Web page (or some extension of the same idea). For signal generators/processors, several output formats (oscilloscope, spectrogramme...), and for processors several calibrated input signals (dirac impulse, ramp, sinusoide..) would be available.

## Integration in Bespoke

* Currently addressed by: nil

[Bespoke](https://www.bespokesynth.com) is a modular DAW for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Bespoke is a software modular synthesizer. It contains a bunch of modules, which you can connect together to create sounds. 
Benedict Gaster work (https://github.com/bgaster/BespokeSynth) uses WebAssembly as the compilation target language, and has already done the BespokeSynth integration. So possibly this work could be directly merged.
An more ambitious approach would be to directly embed the Faust compiler (using the libfaust + LLVM JIT way) with would even produce faster code. This is currently [discused here](https://github.com/BespokeSynth/BespokeSynth/issues/317).

## Integration in Cables.jl

Cables is a tool for creating beautiful interactive content. With an easy to navigate interface and real time visuals, it allows for rapid prototyping and fast adjustments. You are provided with a set of operators, such as mathematical functions, shapes, materials and post processing effects. Connect these to each other with virtual cables to create the experience you have in mind.
Easily export your piece of work at any time. Embed it into your website or use it for any kind of creative installation.

The project would be to integrate the [Faust Web Audio Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grame/libfaust) to dynamically compile and run Faust DSP programs in Cables.jl.

---

## Integration in HISE

HISE is a cross-platform open source audio application for building virtual instruments. It emphasizes on sampling, but includes some basic synthesis features for making hybrid instruments as well as audio effects. You can export the instruments as VST/AU/AAX plugins or as standalone application for Windows / macOS or iOS.

The project would be to integrate the Faust compiler (using the libfaust + LLVM JIT way) into HISE for live editing and then used to generate C++ at compile time. This would allow for much more complex effects development without need to delve into C++ DSP.
This is currently [discused here](https://github.com/christophhart/HISE/issues/224).
